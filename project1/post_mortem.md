## Approach and process 

### 1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

I would think a bit harder before writing so much html code for all my questions. I think there is a better way to loop the questions so I don't have to spend so much time to write so much code.

### 2. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

What went well was my search for info on Chart.js. Originally it was not working but I racked my brains and kept looking for tutorials on what I wanted to do. I was lucky enough to find an example that gave me almost the same chart that I wanted to generate.

Also, I learnt a lot of new things about the code in that I found out the data could not be stored and I had to figure out how to generate the chart on the same page itself.

## Code and code design

### 1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

As said earlier, I would change the way I coded the questions. I spent too much time on the questions coding when I could have done it a better way using loops.

``` 
<div id="question1" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <p class="question"><b>Question 1:</b> I get my biggest thrills when my work is among the best there is.</p>
    <div class="form-check-inline text">
        <label class="form-check-label" for="radio1">
            <input type="radio" class="form-check-input" id="radio1" name="q1" value="1" checked>1

### 2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

Everything else actually!

## Unit 1 Post Mortem

### 1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?

I was not lazy when it came to coding and I was very consistent in using Google to figure out how to do what I wanted to do.

### 2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?

I need to think harder about how to make my code easier to do when it becomes too tedious.

### 3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

2/5 stars difficulty. 5/5 course materials and teaching
